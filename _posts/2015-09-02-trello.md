[Rick Benetti](https://twitter.com/RickBenettiBR) created a clone of the checklist for those who prefer to use [Trello](https://trello.com/wordpresssecuritychecklist).

We created an [organization on Trello](https://trello.com/wordpresssecuritychecklist) to keep the boards divided by language.

In order to copy the desired board to your own user, you just need to follow these steps: **Menu > More > Copy Board**

It's awesome to see this project getting stronger and receiving a lot of collaborations.

Thanks, Rick!
