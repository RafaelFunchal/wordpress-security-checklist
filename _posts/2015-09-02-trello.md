[Rick Benetti](https://twitter.com/RickBenettiBR){:target="_blank"} created a clone of the checklist for those who prefer to use [Trello](https://trello.com/wordpresssecuritychecklist){:target="_blank"}.

[![Trello board]({{ "/img/trello.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://trello.com/wordpresssecuritychecklist){:target="_blank"}

We created an [organization on Trello](https://trello.com/wordpresssecuritychecklist){:target="_blank"} to keep the boards divided by language.

In order to copy the desired board to your own user, you just need to follow these steps: **Menu > More > Copy Board**

It's awesome to see this project getting stronger and receiving a lot of collaborations.

Thanks, Rick!
