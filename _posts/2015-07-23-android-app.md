Since I created this project I've received a lot of positive feedbacks on social networks. **Thank you, guys!**

In order to keep the good vibes, I decided to create a mobile version of the checklist. The website is well rendered on mobile devices, but I believe that an app would make the user experience even better.

Besides that, I used it as an excuse to learn about [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/).

You can see the app screenshots and install it on your Android device on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.wordpresssecuritychecklistapp804039).

Don't forget to give it some stars :-)
