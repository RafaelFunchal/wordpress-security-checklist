That was the [second issue](https://github.com/rafaelfunchal/wordpress-security-checklist/issues/2){:target="_blank"} I created on this project and, thanks to [Fellyph Cintra](https://github.com/fellyph){:target="_blank"}, now it's closed.

Thanks to Fellyph the checklist will look better when you print it.

![printable version]({{ "/img/printable-version.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

A lot of people still use paper to manage their developed projects and now it's possible to *print the checklist without losing the links mentioned in each item*.

Thanks, Fellyph! :-)
