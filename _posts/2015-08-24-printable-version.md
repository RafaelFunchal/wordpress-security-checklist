That was the [second issue](https://github.com/rafaelfunchal/wordpress-security-checklist/issues/2) I created on this project and, thanks to [Fellyph Cintra](https://github.com/fellyph), now it's closed.

Thanks to Fellyph the checklist will look better when you print it.

A lot of people still use paper to manage their developed projects and now it's possible to *print the checklist without losing the links mentioned in each item*.

Thanks, Fellyph! :-)
