[Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) is the best framework, IMHO, to create hybrid apps, but nothing is perfect.

In order to create the app version for iOS it's necessary to use an Apple OS and, nowadays in Brazil, a Macbook costs around US $ 6,500.

I said that nothing is perfect, but the WordPress community *is pretty close to perfection*.  

[Sergio Costa](https://www.facebook.com/sergio.costa.5815) of [Rep√∫blica Interativa](http://republicainterativa.com.br/), **one of the best agencies in Salvador**, liked the project and decided to create the iOS version of our app and, more than that, he published it on [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/security-checklist-for-wordpress/id1035454332?ls=1&mt=8).

**I love the WordPress community!**

Thanks a lot for that, Sergio!
