Finally I found a few time to translate the checkilist to English \o/

Probably you noticed that there are a few strings in Brazilian Portuguese on header and footer. Right now, only the checklist is translated, but I intend to make the entire website multi language friendly soon.

If you have some suggestion, please, poke me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/RafaelFunchal){:target="_blank"} or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rafaelfunchal/wordpress-security-checklist/issues){:target="_blank"}.
